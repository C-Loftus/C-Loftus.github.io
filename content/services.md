[Talon](https://talon.wiki/) is the optimal way to control your computer through voice, and is essential for anyone dealing with RSI, Carpal Tunnel, or other hand conditions. However, it can be difficult to understand. I have used Talon for over 3 years studying Computer Science at Princeton University and working in the healthcare consulting sector.

### I can help you no matter if you are:

- a beginner looking to quickly get the best set up
- an experienced user looking for more customization and a better understanding of Talon scripting
- a team leader or educator looking to support a colleague or student
- a researcher looking to better understand computer accessibility

Sessions can be as long or as short you need. Not sure if your needs fit my services, reach out anyways!
