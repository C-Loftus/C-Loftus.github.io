## Talon Consulting

[Talon](https://talon.wiki/) is the optimal way to control your computer through voice, and is essential for anyone dealing with RSI, Carpal Tunnel, or other hand pain conditions. However, it can be tricky to understand. I have used Talon for over 3 years while completing my Computer Science degree from Princeton University. I can help you no matter if you are:

- a beginner looking to quickly get the best set up
- an experienced user looking for more customization and a better understanding of Talon scripting
- a team leader or educator looking to support a colleague or student
- a researcher looking to better understand computer accessibility

Each session runs for 1 hour. Not sure if your needs fit my services?
