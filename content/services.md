<h1> Accessibility Software Consulting </h1>
</center>

{{< /rawhtml >}}

I have been developing and personally using a variety of software tools like voice control and screen readers for over 6 years on a wide variety of platforms. I would love to help you or your team with your personal or professional accessibility goals.

I have provided software consulting services for accessibility and UX teams at Github Inc. as well as personalized sessions for professionals dealing with health challenges in a wide variety of industries like software, education, or engineering.


## I can help you no matter if you are:

- an individual with a health challenge like carpal tunnel or vision impairment looking to quickly get the best set up for personal needs
- a team leader or educator looking to support a colleague or student
- a researcher looking to better understand computer accessibility
- a developer looking to better understand screen readers or voice control tools from a technical perspective

Sessions can be as long or as short you need. Not sure if your needs fit my services, reach out anyways! I am flexible!
