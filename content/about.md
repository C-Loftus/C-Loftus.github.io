I am software engineer working on infrastructure for global water data for the [Center for Geospatial Solutions](https://cgsearth.org/) at the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/)

In my spare time I am highly interested in software tools for accessibility.

Please feel free to reach out to me through any of the methods listed on my [ contact](/contact) page.
