I am software engineer working on infrastructure for global water data. My professional background and links to academic projects can be found on my [contact](/contact) page.

In my spare time I love to develop socially useful software tools related to [accessibility](https://github.com/C-Loftus/sight-free-talon/). 

Please feel free to reach out to me through any of the methods listed on my [ contact](/contact) page.
