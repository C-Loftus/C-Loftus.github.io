One of the central lessons from open source as a general social movement is that projects tend to succeeed when there is broad usage from a wide variety of stakeholders across demographics. Ubiquitous projects like the Linux kernel, Python, and the Gnome desktop have all found success because they deliberately cast a wide net and are inclusive to users in widely varying use cases.

One of the biggest flaws within Linux and free software generally has been accessibility. A sigificant cause of this is that accessibility has always been seen as an accommodation and not a general purpose improvement. The fact of the matter is that user interfaces which are accessible are also more semantically meaningful and tend to be easier to script for developers. 

The worst victim of this miscategorization are likely: desktop screen readers. Despite the fact that eye strain is a general issue for people of all backgrounds and [artifically synthesized audiobooks](https://github.com/C-Loftus/QuickPiperAudiobook/) are now seeing popularity for general use, screen readers continue to be seen as a last resort and only a painful solution for individuals who are fully blind.

In the past few months I have been extremely impressed with the Orca screen reader on Linux. It is not perfect, but as someone who loves audiobooks, a screenreader is essentially a dynamic and semantically navigable audiobook with any content you wish. While it is vitally important to prioritize the blind, we should also be pragmatic and see that a large software project without revenue generation needs to cast a wide net in order to get a large enough community to support tutorials, documentation, and programmers.

As such, I think there is much to be gained for all in trying to bring screen readers to a more general audience. That means having modes that are less verbose if needed, integrating with natural voices as a first-class priority, and supporting use on portable devices. Regarding the last point, I think there is significant potential in bringing a mobile screen reader to a form factor like we once had with a BlackBerry-style phone. Namely, something with buttons that is portable enough to be used like a iPod yet tactile with enough buttons for a complex screen reader. These sorts of general UX improvements help to reinterpret a screen reader as an interesting productivity tool instead of a specialized accommodation. The latter point should not be underestimated with the recent interest in dumbphones, audiobooks, y2k-style retro tech, and productivity influencers. 

While more money is the obvious solution to improving the state of Linux accessibility, just beginning to change the way we think about the technology helps to include more of the huge spectrum between the sighted and blind and in doing so, widens the community, and puts us on the path for more concrete software improvements.
