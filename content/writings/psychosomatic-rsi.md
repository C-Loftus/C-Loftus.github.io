After talking to others in the [Talon Slack channel](https://talonvoice.com/chat), it came to my attention that there is not a good summary of psychosomatic pain resources specifically in the context of symptoms appearing like hand pain from RSI. While many of the general resources for TMS can apply to any chronic pain health condition, in this post I will give my perspective in hopes that will help other programmers.

_In this post I assume that you have a general understanding of what psychosomatic pain is, but not necessarily its specifics or ways of curing it._

## Who Falls Into This Category

Most books I have read agree that if you have had chronic pain for multiple months (or years) without having a traumatic injury or any progress through imaging or tests, and have not made much progress with traditional physical therapy, you are likely suffering from a condition that is psychosomatic. It is important to note that you could have had a physical injury that initiated the pain, but is no longer the cause. Dr. Sarno goes further, saying how even many patients with disk degeneration does not necessitate back pain.

# Techniques for Healing

## Journaling

Journaling tends to be more emphasized by those taking a psychoanalytic (TMS) approach to chronic pain. It is important to emphasize that the journaling done here is not for keeping a diary or recapping personal events/goals. It is specifically done for the purpose of gaining insight into emotions that one would otherwise repress in typical thoughts, namely repression through translation into pain.

  - _The Cure for Chronic Pain Podcast_ by Nicole Sachs
    - The first few episodes are typically enough to gain a general understanding of the journaling technique

## Meditation

While general mindfulness meditation can be helpful, books like _The Way Out_ tend to focus on somatic tracking. This tends to be similar to body scan meditation and is used for reprogramming the mind and its pain associations. The goal is to feel pain without needing to react negatively to it. One should feel curious and willing to feel all sensations, good or bad, and begin to gain the confidence that nothing is wrong with one's body.

In the context of programming, I find it helpful to do somatic tracking before computer work and midway through a project _before_ the pain raises in intensity. _The Way Out_ specifically says not to do somatic tracking when symptoms are bad since it can reinforce fear and aversion towards pain, and reintroduce the error that the pain is physical.
